# BF
A bash script that converts brainf**k code into c using sed.

To compile, run Compile.sh with your file:

```./Compile.sh ./Imposter.bf```

Brainf**k files can have any extension although the code needs to start with the letter b and end with the letter f as shown in Imposter.bf.

To run the code, mark it as executable and run it like any other program.
